# My e-commerce
This is an ecommerce site (made for learning purpose, NOT deployment) made with Sanity, Next JS and Stripe. Site details such as product information, banner image, etc. can be updated via Sanity and the changes are reflected accordingly on the website. Stripe was used to handle payments.
